# Roadmap:

## Economy & Market

- **Loans / Bank:** Borrow money with interest, repay over time. Bank building or separate "Loan" tab.
- **Price alerts:** Set a notification when a resource reaches a target price (e.g. "Notify when Bitcoin &lt; 20,000 $").
- **Contracts / Orders:** Place limit orders (e.g. "Buy 100 Grain when price ≤ 8 $").
- **Market events:** Random events (bad harvest, discovery, crisis) that temporarily change base prices or supply.
- **Inflation / currency:** Optional inflation over years (prices slowly rise) or a second currency.
- **Tax / expenses:** Periodic costs (e.g. tax on buildings or income) to add pressure.

---

## Buildings & Production

- **Sell buildings:** Sell buildings back for part of the cost to free space or get quick cash.
- **Maintenance:** Buildings cost a small amount per day/tick (repairs, wages).
- **Production chains:** Some buildings consume one resource and produce another (e.g. Mill: Grain → Flour).
- **Storage limits:** Cap total stock per resource or globally; upgrade storage with buildings or upgrades.
- **Workers / population:** Abstract "workers" that buildings need; hire with money or housing.

---

## Real Estate

- **Sell real estate:** Sell properties back (e.g. for 70% of purchase price).
- **Rent history:** Log of rent collected per property or total over time.
- **Tenant satisfaction / vacancy:** Chance that rent is lower if "satisfaction" is low (optional difficulty).
- **Real estate events:** Occasional events (repairs, vacancy) that reduce rent for one cycle.

---

## Progression & Meta

- **Prestige / New Game+:** Reset with a bonus (e.g. +10% income, starting level 5) to replay with an edge.
- **Daily / weekly challenges:** "Earn 10,000 $ from selling Fish" or "Own 5 different currencies" for extra $/XP.
- **Quests / missions:** Short objectives with story text and rewards (e.g. "Trader's Guild wants 50 Silk").
- **Skill tree / perks:** Spend XP on passive perks (e.g. "5% cheaper buildings", "1% more sell price").
- **Difficulty levels:** Easy / Normal / Hard (e.g. different starting money, prices, or costs).

---

## UI & UX

- **Statistics screen:** Total $ earned/spent, most traded good, days played, biggest single sale, etc.
- **Notifications / toasts:** Small popup when achievement unlocked, rent collected, or level up.
- **Sound:** Optional sounds for buy/sell, tick, achievement, level up.
- **Themes:** Dark (current), light, or high-contrast color scheme.
- **Keyboard shortcuts:** e.g. 1–6 for tabs, Space to advance day (if manual option exists).
- **Export save:** Download save as JSON for backup or transfer.
- **Language switch:** Toggle EN/DE (or more) without changing code each time.

---

## Content

- **More goods:** Additional resources per category (e.g. new foods, new metals).
- **More buildings:** More production and real estate options, including niche ones.
- **Seasons:** Spring/summer/autumn/winter with small price modifiers (e.g. Grain cheaper after harvest).
- **Regions / cities:** Different "markets" with different base prices; travel or switch market.
- **Special / rare goods:** Rare drops or one-time goods for achievements or quests.

---

## Technical & Balance

- **Offline progress:** Approximate income for time spent offline (e.g. cap at 24 h).
- **Cloud save:** Optional save to account/server (needs backend).
- **Balance pass:** Review building costs vs. income, XP curve, and achievement rewards.
- **Mobile-friendly:** Touch-friendly buttons, responsive layout for small screens.
- **Accessibility:** Better focus styles, reduced motion option, screen reader hints.
